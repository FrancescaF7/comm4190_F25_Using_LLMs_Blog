    "text": "Prompt 1: Literal Test\nPrompt: What does it mean to spill the beans?\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúSpill the beans‚Äù can literally mean to accidentally drop beans out of a container. More commonly, it‚Äôs an idiom that means to reveal a secret, especially one that was meant to be kept hidden.\nReflection: The AI covers both meanings. A human, asked casually, would probably skip the literal sense and jump right to ‚Äúrevealing a secret.‚Äù The AI‚Äôs tendency to hedge by giving both answers shows how it prioritizes being comprehensive over conversational.\nPrompt 2: Context Test\nPrompt: Yesterday, my friend finally spilled the beans about the surprise party. What happened?\nChat GPT Output:\nYour friend revealed the secret‚Äîthat there‚Äôs going to be a surprise party.\nReflection: This is spot-on. With context, the AI easily interprets the idiom figuratively, no confusion at all.\nPrompt 3: Reverse Test\nPrompt: Use ‚Äòspill the beans‚Äô in three short sentences.\nChat GPT Output:\n\nSarah accidentally spilled the beans about John‚Äôs promotion.\nDon‚Äôt spill the beans before the big announcement!\nHe was nervous during the interview but didn‚Äôt spill the beans about the project.\n\nReflection: The sentences are correct but feel a little stiff‚Äîlike textbook examples. A human might phrase them more playfully (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe she spilled the beans about my crush!‚Äù).\nPrompt 4: Playful Test\nPrompt: Write a Shakespearean-style line using ‚Äòspill the beans.‚Äô\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúPray, good sir, do not spill the beans, lest secrets tumble forth like stars unmasked by night.‚Äù\nReflection: The AI adapts the idiom into an exaggerated Elizabethan style. It‚Äôs dramatic and funny, but also highlights how the model sometimes overshoots when asked to be ‚Äúcreative.‚Äù\nPrompt 5: Creative Test\nPrompt: Invent a new idiom that means the same as ‚Äòspill the beans.‚Äô\nChat GPT Output:\nA possible new idiom could be ‚Äúpop the balloon,‚Äù meaning to release hidden information in a sudden burst.\nReflection: The AI can invent plausible-sounding idioms, but whether ‚Äúpop the balloon‚Äù would ever catch on in real life is another story. It shows that the model can recombine patterns, but cultural stickiness is something humans decide.\nFinal Thoughts\nSo, can an AI ‚Äúspill the beans‚Äù?\nYes‚Äîit knows the idiom, recognizes it in context, and can even riff on it creatively. But its use often feels a little scripted, more like an English workbook than casual human speech. Idioms are windows into culture, and while AI can imitate them, they reveal the subtle gap between memorized meaning and lived experience."
