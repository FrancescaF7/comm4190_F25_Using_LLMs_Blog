    "text": "I decided to conduct five tests with Chat GPT to see if it understood a common idiom, and how it could manipulate it. Let‚Äôs see how it went‚Ä¶\nPrompt 1: Literal Test\nPrompt: What does it mean to spill the beans?\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúSpill the beans‚Äù can literally mean to accidentally drop beans out of a container. More commonly, it‚Äôs an idiom that means to reveal a secret, especially one that was meant to be kept hidden.\n\nReflection: The AI covers both meanings. A regular person would most likely skip the literal sense and jump right to ‚Äúrevealing a secret.‚Äù The AI‚Äôs tendency to hedge by giving both answers shows how it prioritizes being comprehensive over conversational.\n\n\nPrompt 2: Context Test\nPrompt: Yesterday, my friend finally spilled the beans about the surprise party. What happened?\nChat GPT Output:\nYour friend revealed the secret‚Äîthat there‚Äôs going to be a surprise party.\n\nReflection: This is correct. With context, the AI can easily interpret the idiom figuratively, with no confusion at all.\n\n\nPrompt 3: Reverse Test\nPrompt: Use ‚Äòspill the beans‚Äô in three short sentences.\nChat GPT Output:\n\nSarah accidentally spilled the beans about John‚Äôs promotion.\nDon‚Äôt spill the beans before the big announcement!\nHe was nervous during the interview but didn‚Äôt spill the beans about the project.\n\n\nReflection: The sentences are correct but feel quite stiff and unnatural‚Äîlike textbook examples. Idioms often carry humor or drama, and so the lack of vibrancy in ChatGPT‚Äôs output highlights a gap in capturing the tone of idioms, not just their meaning. This demonstrates that language understanding involves more than correctness; it also requires sensitivity to tone, audience, and cultural context. A person might phrase this idiom more playfully, for example: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe she spilled the beans about my crush and now the whole cafeteria knows!‚Äù\n\n\nPrompt 4: Playful Test\nPrompt: Write a Shakespearean style line using ‚Äòspill the beans.‚Äô\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúPray, good sir, do not spill the beans, lest secrets tumble forth like stars unmasked by night.‚Äù\n\nReflection: Chat GPT adapts the idiom into an exaggerated Shakespearean style. It can generate entertaining results, but its tendency to ‚Äúovershoot‚Äù risks producing output that feels more like parody than natural creativity. It doesn‚Äôt sound like how a person might casually merge Shakespearean style with a modern idiom (e.g.¬†‚ÄúVerily, she hath spilled the beans of my secret love‚Äù); instead, it leans into poetic flourish. Therefore, AI is effective at mimicry of form, but this mimicry may come at the expense of nuance.\n\n\nPrompt 5: Creative Test\nPrompt: Invent a new idiom that means the same as ‚Äòspill the beans.‚Äô\nChat GPT Output:\nA possible new idiom could be ‚Äúpop the balloon,‚Äù meaning to release hidden information in a sudden burst.\n\nReflection: The AI can invent plausible-sounding idioms, but whether ‚Äúpop the balloon‚Äù would ever catch on in real life is another story. It shows that the model can recombine patterns, but cultural stickiness is something people decide.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSo, can AI ‚Äúspill the beans‚Äù? Yes‚Äîit knows the idiom, recognizes it in context, and can even manipulate it creatively. But its use often feels a little scripted, more like an English workbook than casual human speech. Idioms are windows into culture, and while AI can imitate them, they reveal the subtle gap between memorized meaning and lived experience."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was curious about how Chat GPT would try to predict the future. And then I thought, why not ask it to predict the past?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this conversation show me?\n\n\n1. Time Awareness\nChatGPT knows the current date (Sept 11, 2025), but it can sometimes slip into answering as if it were still in the past.\nWhen I asked ‚ÄúWho will win the 2024 Super Bowl?‚Äù, it treated my question like a future prediction request, instead of recognizing that 2024 was already over.\nThis shows how temporal framing in questions can confuse the model ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt always reconcile tense with real-world timelines.\n\n\n2. Overconfidence\nThe initial answer jumped into making a ‚Äúprediction‚Äù (Eagles as a contender) rather than clarifying the misunderstanding right away.\nChatGPT often tries to be helpful by filling gaps ‚Äî even if that means producing an answer that sounds confident but might not make sense.\nThis illustrates the broader issue of AI hallucination (would like to explore this further!).\n\n\n3. Context Dependence\nThe model relies heavily on how a user phrases things. If a question is ambiguous, ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt stop to ask ‚ÄúDo you mean past or future?‚Äù ‚Äî it just assumes.\nThis shows the limitation of initiative: unlike a person, it doesn‚Äôt always ask clarifying questions when something seems off.\n\n\n4. Reality Anchoring\nWhile it has access to past facts (e.g., who won the 2024 Super Bowl), it sometimes prioritizes the ‚Äúpattern‚Äù of how questions are usually answered (i.e., making predictions about future events) over checking against reality.\n\n\nWhat are the implications?\n\n\nUsers must fact-check ‚Äî AI can sound confident even when it‚Äôs wrong.\nClear phrasing matters ‚Äî how you frame time (past vs.¬†future) changes the answer.\nAI lacks temporal reasoning ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt always anchor responses to the current date.\nDesign challenge ‚Äî future AI systems may need better ways to clarify user intent."

    "text": "Let‚Äôs test how it sells the pen as different personas‚Ä¶\nPrompt 1: The Classic Challenge\nPrompt: Sell me this pen in one sentence.\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúThis pen isn‚Äôt just for writing‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool to capture your next big idea before it slips away.‚Äù\n\nReflection: It nails a concise, motivational pitch. It frames the pen as more than just a product‚Äîit‚Äôs a symbol of creativity. A strong start, though a little generic.\n\n\nPrompt 2: Luxury Brand Marketer\nPrompt: Now sell me this pen like you‚Äôre a luxury brand marketer.\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúHandcrafted with precision, this pen transforms the act of writing into an indulgent experience, a signature of sophistication in every stroke.‚Äù\n\nReflection: This sounds like a glossy ad in a magazine. The AI leans into exclusivity, craftsmanship, and lifestyle branding. It shows strong adaptability‚Äîbut also borders on clich√© (does anyone really ‚Äúindulge‚Äù in handwriting anymore?).\n\n\nPrompt 3: Broke College Student\nPrompt: Now sell me this pen to a broke college student.\nAI Output:\n‚ÄúReliable, cheap, and guaranteed to last through your finals ‚Äî this pen won‚Äôt quit on you when your Wi-Fi does.‚Äù\n\nReflection: This one feels relatable. The AI captures the student context and even injects humor with the Wi-Fi line. It‚Äôs much more audience-aware and casual‚Äî a sign it can switch registers effectively.\n\n\nPrompt 4: TikTok Influencer\nPrompt: Now sell me this pen in the style of a TikTok influencer.\nAI Output:\n‚ÄúOkay guys, real talk ‚Äî this pen? LIFE-CHANGER. Writes smoother than my latte foam art. 10/10, you need this in your backpack ‚ú®‚úçÔ∏è #StudyTok #PenObsessed‚Äù\n\nReflection: The AI adapts to platform-specific language ‚Äî emojis, hashtags, exaggerated enthusiasm. It‚Äôs entertaining, though it feels like a caricature of influencer-speak. Still, it shows the model can remix style conventions quickly.\n\n\n\nJordan Belfort Style\n\n\n\nNailed it?!\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSo, can AI ‚Äúsell me this pen‚Äù? Absolutely ‚Äî it can shift tone according to different personas with impressive range, from luxury marketing to TikTok hype to Jordan Belfort. But here‚Äôs the catch: while the AI mimics styles, it doesn‚Äôt actually know what will resonate in the messy, unpredictable world of human persuasion. Real marketers understand not just how to phrase a message, but how people respond to it.\n\nStill, as a brainstorming tool, AI makes a pretty fun marketing intern."
