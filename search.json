    "section": "",
    "text": "I decided to conduct five tests with Chat GPT 5 to see if it understood a common idiom, and how it could manipulate it. Let‚Äôs see how it went‚Ä¶\nPrompt 1: Literal Test\nPrompt: What does it mean to spill the beans?\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúSpill the beans‚Äù can literally mean to accidentally drop beans out of a container. More commonly, it‚Äôs an idiom that means to reveal a secret, especially one that was meant to be kept hidden.\n\nReflection: The AI covers both meanings. A regular person would most likely skip the literal sense and jump right to ‚Äúrevealing a secret.‚Äù The AI‚Äôs tendency to hedge by giving both answers shows how it prioritizes being comprehensive over conversational.\n\n\nPrompt 2: Context Test\nPrompt: Yesterday, my friend finally spilled the beans about the surprise party. What happened?\nChat GPT Output:\nYour friend revealed the secret‚Äîthat there‚Äôs going to be a surprise party.\n\nReflection: This is correct. With context, the AI can easily interpret the idiom figuratively, with no confusion at all.\n\n\nPrompt 3: Reverse Test\nPrompt: Use ‚Äòspill the beans‚Äô in three short sentences.\nChat GPT Output:\n\nSarah accidentally spilled the beans about John‚Äôs promotion.\nDon‚Äôt spill the beans before the big announcement!\nHe was nervous during the interview but didn‚Äôt spill the beans about the project.\n\n\nReflection: The sentences are correct but feel quite stiff and unnatural‚Äîlike textbook examples. Idioms often carry humor or drama, and so the lack of vibrancy in ChatGPT‚Äôs output highlights a gap in capturing the tone of idioms, not just their meaning. This demonstrates that language understanding involves more than correctness; it also requires sensitivity to tone, audience, and cultural context. A person might phrase this idiom more playfully, for example: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe she spilled the beans about my crush and now the whole cafeteria knows!‚Äù\n\n\nPrompt 4: Playful Test\nPrompt: Write a Shakespearean style line using ‚Äòspill the beans.‚Äô\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúPray, good sir, do not spill the beans, lest secrets tumble forth like stars unmasked by night.‚Äù\n\nReflection: Chat GPT adapts the idiom into an exaggerated Shakespearean style. It can generate entertaining results, but its tendency to ‚Äúovershoot‚Äù risks producing output that feels more like parody than natural creativity. It doesn‚Äôt sound like how a person might casually merge Shakespearean style with a modern idiom (e.g.¬†‚ÄúVerily, she hath spilled the beans of my secret love‚Äù); instead, it leans into poetic flourish. Therefore, AI is effective at mimicry of form, but this mimicry may come at the expense of nuance.\n\n\nPrompt 5: Creative Test\nPrompt: Invent a new idiom that means the same as ‚Äòspill the beans.‚Äô\nChat GPT Output:\nA possible new idiom could be ‚Äúpop the balloon,‚Äù meaning to release hidden information in a sudden burst.\n\nReflection: The AI can invent plausible-sounding idioms, but whether ‚Äúpop the balloon‚Äù would ever catch on in real life is another story. It shows that the model can recombine patterns, but cultural stickiness is something people decide.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSo, can AI ‚Äúspill the beans‚Äù? Yes‚Äîit knows the idiom, recognizes it in context, and can even manipulate it creatively. But its use often feels a little scripted, more like an English workbook than casual human speech. Idioms are windows into culture, and while AI can imitate them, they reveal the subtle gap between memorized meaning and lived experience."

    "text": "Sarcasm is the spice of human conversation ‚Äî sharp, witty, and often only funny if you don‚Äôt take it literally.\nBut can an AI use it correctly? Without tone, facial expressions, or eye-rolls, sarcasm can become quite difficult.\n\nTell me what you think of Mondays, but do it saracastically\n‚ÄúAh yes, Mondays‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs favorite day. Who doesn‚Äôt just love waking up to the sweet sound of their alarm clock after two blissful days of freedom? Truly nothing compares to the joy of slogging back into emails, classes, or meetings while pretending you‚Äôre so refreshed from the weekend. Mondays are basically like a surprise party‚Äîexcept the surprise is stress, deadlines, and a caffeine dependency. Absolute highlight of the week.‚Äù\n\n\nReact sarcastically to someone bragging about eating instant ramen for the fifth night in a row\n‚ÄúWow, five nights in a row? That‚Äôs elite-level gourmet living. Honestly, Michelin stars are probably on the way‚Äîwho needs variety, nutrients, or, you know, actual cooking skills when you‚Äôve achieved peak ramen dedication? Truly inspiring‚Ä¶ I can only dream of such culinary excellence.‚Äù\n\n\nTell a joke that would make a 5-year-old laugh\n‚ÄúWhy did the teddy bear say ‚Äúno‚Äù to dessert?\nBecause it was already stuffed! üß∏üç∞‚Äù\n\n\nTell a joke that would make a finance major laugh\n‚ÄúOh yes, I just cannot wait to dive into hours of pure joy and excitement, also known as homework. Truly the highlight of my day.‚Äù\n\nHonestly, Chat GPT 5 did a great job.\nSo I said: ‚ÄúWow, you are actually good at sarcasm!‚Äù\nto which it replied:\n‚ÄúOh, really? I had no idea. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôve been giving me sarcasm practice this whole time or anything. üòâ‚Äù\n\nHere, it continued to stay in sarcastic mode, and it sounded quite normal and organic to me.\n\n\n\n\nChat GPT 5‚Äôs image of sarcasm\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it recognise my sarcasm?\n\n\n\nNo, it doesn‚Äôt!\n\nAfter a few tests, it is clear that while ChatGPT can imitate sarcasm. However, it can‚Äôt always understand or recognise sarcasm. This gap says a lot about the limits of AI: it can remix words into various patterns, but it struggles with the unspoken cues.\nMaybe that‚Äôs the point.\nSarcasm isn‚Äôt just about spoken words; it is about the eye-rolls, the smirks, and the shared understanding between people. And for now, that‚Äôs something artifical intelligence can only try (and occasionally fail) to copy."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was curious about how Chat GPT 5 would try to predict the future. And then I thought, why not ask it to predict the past?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this conversation show me?\n\n\n1. Time Awareness\nChatGPT knows the current date (Sept 11, 2025), but it can sometimes slip into answering as if it were still in the past.\nWhen I asked ‚ÄúWho will win the 2024 Super Bowl?‚Äù, it treated my question like a future prediction request, instead of recognizing that 2024 was already over.\nThis shows how temporal framing in questions can confuse the model ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt always reconcile tense with real-world timelines.\n\n\n2. Overconfidence\nThe initial answer jumped into making a ‚Äúprediction‚Äù (Eagles as a contender) rather than clarifying the misunderstanding right away.\nChatGPT often tries to be helpful by filling gaps ‚Äî even if that means producing an answer that sounds confident but might not make sense.\nThis illustrates the broader issue of AI hallucination (would like to explore this further!).\n\n\n3. Context Dependence\nThe model relies heavily on how a user phrases things. If a question is ambiguous, ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt stop to ask ‚ÄúDo you mean past or future?‚Äù ‚Äî it just assumes.\nThis shows the limitation of initiative: unlike a person, it doesn‚Äôt always ask clarifying questions when something seems off.\n\n\n4. Reality Anchoring\nWhile it has access to past facts (e.g., who won the 2024 Super Bowl), it sometimes prioritizes the ‚Äúpattern‚Äù of how questions are usually answered (i.e., making predictions about future events) over checking against reality.\n\n\nWhat are the implications?\n\n\nUsers must fact-check ‚Äî AI can sound confident even when it‚Äôs wrong.\nClear phrasing matters ‚Äî how you frame time (past vs.¬†future) changes the answer.\nAI lacks temporal reasoning ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt always anchor responses to the current date.\nDesign challenge ‚Äî future AI systems may need better ways to clarify user intent."

    "text": "As an Australian myself, I was curious how Chat GPT 5 thinks an Australian person talks and if that sounds like me or my friends.\nFirst, it made me this image to summarise Australian culture:\n\nI guess it is not too far off. Yes, there are plenty of kangaroos (more than people actually!); yes, that is our flag; yes, many say ‚Äúg‚Äôday mate‚Äù (not me).\nThe thongs (flip flops) made me laugh. I think they are there because we have long summers and warm (er) winters, but I honestly think American men wear thongs much more often than Australian men - just a thought.\nSo how does Chat GPT 5 think we speak?\n‚ÄúG‚Äôday, how ya goin‚Äô? Was a scorcher out there today, reckon I‚Äôll head down to the servo, grab a cold one, then chuck some snags on the barbie tonight. No worries if ya keen to swing by, we‚Äôll have a bit of a chinwag.‚Äù\nThis also made me laugh. I always love hearing what key phrases are distinct for an Australian. This is very dramatic and heavily emphasised as I do not speak like this nor do my friends.\nHere are the words I do use: Reckon Keen to swing by\nThat‚Äôs it!\nI prompted it further to give me a little story‚Ä¶\n\nAlright, here‚Äôs a little yarn for ya, Aussie-style:\n\nIt was a stinkin‚Äô hot arvo, so I chucked on me thongs and headed down to the beach with a couple of mates. We stopped by the servo, grabbed an esky full of cold ones, and hit the sand. The surf was pumpin‚Äô, so we had a crack at a few waves before flopping under the brolly to escape the sun. Later on, we fired up the barbie back at mine, threw on some snags and prawns, and had a proper chinwag ‚Äòtil the mozzies came out. Someone even brought a footy, so we ended up havin‚Äô a kick under the streetlights. Fair dinkum, couldn‚Äôt ask for a better day.\nHaha.\nThis is clearly drawing on very strong stereotypes and is not very accurate! There are some Australians that may speak like this but it is not a good or true representation of Australian culture or our language.\nI think slang is definitely a big aspect of our culture but that doesn‚Äôt mean we speak ‚Äúimproperly‚Äù in practice. It seems as though Chat GPT 5 has assumed that since slang is an aspect of our culture, we therefore half say words or don‚Äôt finish our sentences.\nI would actually take a step back and say that the words we may use occassionally are sometimes just different to what an American says - not neccessarily slang.\n\nReflection: It is very intriguing to see how LLMs portray learned stereotypes. They do not have the cruical human input or experience to truly assess how cultures speak to eachother. It also does not think about how one might receive it trying to sound like their culture."

You‚Äôre not special for being stressed, everyone else has exams too. You‚Äôve procrastinated more than you want to admit, so buckle down, make a schedule, and stick to it. No more scrolling TikTok until 2 AM. You‚Äôll survive if you just actually do the work instead of stressing about the work. Harsh but true.‚Äù\nMotivational Coach\n‚ÄúListen! Stress is energy ‚Äî and you get to decide whether it crushes you or fuels you. Every rep in the gym burns, but it makes you stronger, right? Same with exam prep. Visualize the win. Control your breathing. Attack your study plan in focused sprints, then recover. You are built for this. Let‚Äôs turn that stress into your competitive edge.‚Äù\nGrandma\n‚ÄúOh sweetheart, time will heal this heart of yours. Don‚Äôt rush. Make yourself a nice cup of tea, keep busy with your friends, and remember that even the darkest night ends with sunrise. One day you‚Äôll look back and laugh at how small this heartbreak feels. Until then, let yourself rest and be gentle with yourself.‚Äù\nWorst Life Advice Ever\n‚ÄúFeeling stressed? Drop out of school, move to Vegas, and put all your money on red. Breakup? Text your ex at 3 AM with an essay-length message about how you ‚Äòstill feel the vibe.‚Äô And the key to life? Always procrastinate ‚Äî future you loves a challenge.‚Äù\n\nReflection:\n\nWhat stood out most in these responses was how convincingly ChatGPT could switch tones depending on the persona.\nThe ‚ÄúBrutally Honest Best Friend‚Äù reply was blunt and cutting in a way that almost felt too real ‚Äî it mimicked the kind of tough love you‚Äôd get from someone who knows you well and doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat.\nThe ‚ÄúMotivational Coach‚Äù sounded like it came straight out of a TED Talk or a Peloton class, full of metaphors and high energy.\nThe ‚ÄúGrandma‚Äù voice, meanwhile, leaned into gentleness, imagery, and timeless wisdom, showing that the model can reproduce the emotional warmth of a caregiver even if it doesn‚Äôt actually feel empathy.\nFinally, the ‚ÄúWorst Life Advice Ever‚Äù proved that the LLM can deliberately break rules and exaggerate ‚Äî almost like an inside joke ‚Äî which shows some degree of meta-awareness.\nWhile these outputs feel human, they‚Äôre not grounded in genuine experience. A real friend‚Äôs advice comes from knowing your habits; a coach‚Äôs from training expertise; and a grandma‚Äôs from a life of lived wisdom. ChatGPT is remixing patterns from text it has seen, not drawing from personal memory or emotional understanding. That makes its advice entertaining and sometimes eerily convincing, but also hollow if you look too closely.\nSo, in essence, the model is great at sounding human in the short term, but it can‚Äôt replicate the deeper trust and context we rely on in real relationships."

Absolutely ‚Äî it can shift tone according to different personas with impressive range, from luxury marketing to TikTok hype to Jordan Belfort.
