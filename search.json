Humans usually draw on psychology, context, and improvisation. But can an AI marketing intern pull it off?\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 10, 2025\n\n\nFrancesca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan AI Really ‚ÄòSpill the Beans‚Äô?\n\n\n\nLLMs\n\nPrompting\n\nLogic\n\n\n\nEver wondered if an AI can ‚Äúspill the beans‚Äù the same way we do? Idioms are tricky‚Äîwhat we humans instantly understand as figurative language often needs cultural background and lived experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 10, 2025\n\n\nFrancesca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA test post\n\n\n\nLLMs\n\nPrompting\n\nLogic\n\n\n\nAn example post from a Jupyter notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 2, 2024\n\n\nAn LLM User\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Prompt 1: Literal Test\nPrompt: What does it mean to spill the beans?\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúSpill the beans‚Äù can literally mean to accidentally drop beans out of a container. More commonly, it‚Äôs an idiom that means to reveal a secret, especially one that was meant to be kept hidden.\n\nReflection: The AI covers both meanings. A human, asked casually, would probably skip the literal sense and jump right to ‚Äúrevealing a secret.‚Äù The AI‚Äôs tendency to hedge by giving both answers shows how it prioritizes being comprehensive over conversational.\n\n\nPrompt 2: Context Test\nPrompt: Yesterday, my friend finally spilled the beans about the surprise party. What happened?\nChat GPT Output:\nYour friend revealed the secret‚Äîthat there‚Äôs going to be a surprise party.\n\nReflection: This is spot-on. With context, the AI easily interprets the idiom figuratively, no confusion at all.\n\n\nPrompt 3: Reverse Test\nPrompt: Use ‚Äòspill the beans‚Äô in three short sentences.\nChat GPT Output:\n\nSarah accidentally spilled the beans about John‚Äôs promotion.\nDon‚Äôt spill the beans before the big announcement!\nHe was nervous during the interview but didn‚Äôt spill the beans about the project.\n\n\nReflection: The sentences are correct but feel a little stiff‚Äîlike textbook examples. A human might phrase them more playfully (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe she spilled the beans about my crush!‚Äù).\n\n\nPrompt 4: Playful Test\nPrompt: Write a Shakespearean-style line using ‚Äòspill the beans.‚Äô\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúPray, good sir, do not spill the beans, lest secrets tumble forth like stars unmasked by night.‚Äù\n\nReflection: The AI adapts the idiom into an exaggerated Elizabethan style. It‚Äôs dramatic and funny, but also highlights how the model sometimes overshoots when asked to be ‚Äúcreative.‚Äù\n\n\nPrompt 5: Creative Test\nPrompt: Invent a new idiom that means the same as ‚Äòspill the beans.‚Äô\nChat GPT Output:\nA possible new idiom could be ‚Äúpop the balloon,‚Äù meaning to release hidden information in a sudden burst.\n\nReflection: The AI can invent plausible-sounding idioms, but whether ‚Äúpop the balloon‚Äù would ever catch on in real life is another story. It shows that the model can recombine patterns, but cultural stickiness is something humans decide.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSo, can an AI ‚Äúspill the beans‚Äù? Yes‚Äîit knows the idiom, recognizes it in context, and can even riff on it creatively. But its use often feels a little scripted, more like an English workbook than casual human speech. Idioms are windows into culture, and while AI can imitate them, they reveal the subtle gap between memorized meaning and lived experience."

    "text": "Prompt 1: The Classic Challenge\nPrompt: Sell me this pen in one sentence.\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúThis pen isn‚Äôt just for writing‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool to capture your next big idea before it slips away.‚Äù\nReflection: The AI nails a concise, motivational pitch. It frames the pen as more than just a product ‚Äî it‚Äôs a symbol of creativity. A strong start, though a little generic.\nPrompt 2: Luxury Brand Marketer\nPrompt: Now sell me this pen like you‚Äôre a luxury brand marketer.\nChat GPT Output:\n‚ÄúHandcrafted with precision, this pen transforms the act of writing into an indulgent experience, a signature of sophistication in every stroke.‚Äù\nReflection: This sounds like a glossy ad in Vogue. The AI leans into exclusivity, craftsmanship, and lifestyle branding. It shows strong adaptability ‚Äî but also borders on clich√© (does anyone really ‚Äúindulge‚Äù in handwriting anymore?).\nPrompt 3: Broke College Student\nPrompt: Now sell me this pen to a broke college student.\nAI Output:\n‚ÄúReliable, cheap, and guaranteed to last through your finals ‚Äî this pen won‚Äôt quit on you when your Wi-Fi does.‚Äù\nReflection: This one feels relatable. The AI captures the student context and even injects humor with the Wi-Fi line. It‚Äôs much more audience-aware and casual ‚Äî a sign it can switch registers effectively.\nPrompt 4: TikTok Influencer\nPrompt: Now sell me this pen in the style of a TikTok influencer.\nAI Output:\n‚ÄúOkay guys, real talk ‚Äî this pen? LIFE-CHANGER. Writes smoother than my latte foam art. 10/10, you need this in your backpack ‚ú®‚úçÔ∏è #StudyTok #PenObsessed‚Äù\nReflection: The AI adapts to platform-specific language ‚Äî emojis, hashtags, exaggerated enthusiasm. It‚Äôs entertaining, though it feels like a caricature of influencer-speak. Still, it shows the model can remix style conventions quickly.\nFinal Thoughts\nSo, can an AI ‚Äúsell me this pen‚Äù? Absolutely ‚Äî it can shift tone across audiences with impressive range, from luxury branding to TikTok hype. But here‚Äôs the catch: while the AI mimics styles, it doesn‚Äôt actually know what will resonate in the messy, unpredictable world of human persuasion. Real marketers understand not just how to phrase a message, but how people respond to it.\nStill, as a brainstorming tool, the AI makes a pretty fun (and surprisingly effective) marketing intern."
