    "In his book *Co-intelligence*, Ethan Mollick highlights that working with AI should not always be serious; and ometimes the best way to understand how humans and AI can collaborate is to play. And so, in keeping with the book, what better test of play than the limerick?\n",

    "A limerick has rules — five lines, a strict AABBA rhyme scheme, and a bouncy rhythm - but it also invites absurdity, wit, and creativity. It is the perfect lab for exploring human–AI co-intelligence."

    "What I noticed is that AI can nail a limerick one moment and miss the mark the next. Sometimes it gets it right — sharp rhymes, clean rhythm, even a clever punchline. But other times it gets stumped - forcing awkward word choices, slipping into nonsense, or forgetting the five-line rule altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "That contrast is the real lesson. AI is great at generating possibilities, but not at knowing which ones are actually good. The human role is to sift, guide, and refine.\n",
