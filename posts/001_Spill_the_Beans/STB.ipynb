    "This demonstrates that language understanding involves more than correctness; it also requires sensitivity to tone, audience, and cultural context.

    "Chat GPT adapts the idiom into an exaggerated Shakespearean style. It can generate entertaining results, but its tendency to “overshoot” risks producing output that feels more like parody than natural creativity. It doesn’t sound like how a person might casually merge Shakespearean style with a modern idiom (e.g. “Verily, she hath spilled the beans of my secret love”); instead, it leans into poetic flourish. Therefore, AI is effective at mimicry of form, but this mimicry may come at the expense of nuance.</p>\n",

Idioms are windows into culture, and while AI can imitate them, they reveal the subtle gap between memorized meaning and lived experience.</p>"
