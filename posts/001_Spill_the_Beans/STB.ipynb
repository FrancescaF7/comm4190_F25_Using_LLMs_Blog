    "“Spill the beans” can literally mean to accidentally drop beans out of a container. More commonly, it’s an idiom that means to reveal a secret, especially one that was meant to be kept hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection:\n",
    "The AI covers both meanings. A human, asked casually, would probably skip the literal sense and jump right to “revealing a secret.” The AI’s tendency to hedge by giving both answers shows how it prioritizes being comprehensive over conversational."

Idioms are windows into culture, and while AI can imitate them, they reveal the subtle gap between memorized meaning and lived experience."
