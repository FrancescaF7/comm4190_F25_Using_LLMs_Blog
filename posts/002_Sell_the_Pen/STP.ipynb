    "So, can an AI “sell me this pen”? Absolutely — it can shift tone across audiences with impressive range, from luxury branding to TikTok hype. But here’s the catch: while the AI mimics styles, it doesn’t actually know what will resonate in the messy, unpredictable world of human persuasion. Real marketers understand not just how to phrase a message, but how people respond to it.\n",
