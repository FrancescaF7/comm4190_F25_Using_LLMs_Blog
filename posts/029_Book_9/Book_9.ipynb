    "# The Playfulness Principle: Why Experimentation Is the Future of AI Literacy\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Mollick’s strongest themes is the idea that the best AI users are the most playful. Not the most technical, not the most cautious, but the most willing to try things, break things, and see what happens. He argues that because AI is probabilistic and generative—not deterministic—exploration is more valuable than precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reframing really resonated with me. We’re used to thinking of technology as something rigid, where there are “right” and “wrong” commands. But Mollick positions AI as a sandbox: the more we experiment, the more we understand its boundaries, capabilities, and weirdness. Play is a form of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "He illustrates this with examples of people who stumbled onto new workflows, creative breakthroughs, and even new genres simply by trying unorthodox prompts. The lesson is not that AI rewards chaos; it’s that curiosity is the new literacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This changed how I approach AI in my own work. Instead of worrying about the perfect prompt, I now iterate quickly, test different tones, mix modalities, and ask the model to critique its own output. The process feels less like engineering and more like improvisation. And that mindset shifts everything — it makes AI feel empowering rather than intimidating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mollick’s final point is that playful people will shape the future of AI. Not because they know more, but because they ask more. They discover the edges. They turn glitches into innovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be good at AI, Mollick suggests, we must relearn how to play. And that might be the most human lesson in the whole book."
